# SumOfNodeBetweenTwoNodesInBT
Sum of Nodes Between Two Nodes in Binary Tree in Java

The requirements for this problem came from a problem
I was discussing with a software engineer. I am sure
this or very similar problem may be found in one or more
web sites offering programming problems to solve i.e.,
Codility_, HackerRank, LeetCode.

If interested in my approach and comments I invite you to
read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn and refresh 
concepts is to read and experiment. I hav ebeen told that
practice makes perfect. Still searching for perfrction :o)

Enjoy;
